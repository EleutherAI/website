## {class="content-block"}
- #### [GPT&#8209;Neo](projects/gpt-neo/)
    - [![alt](../../images/art49.png)](projects/gpt-neo/)
    - An implementation of model & data-parallel GPT&#8209;2 and GPT&#8209;3-like models, utilizing Mesh&nbsp;Tensorflow for distributed support. 
    - completed
- #### [GPT&#8209;NeoX](projects/gpt-neox/)
    - [![alt](../../images/art50.png) ](projects/gpt-neox/)
    - An implementation of 3D-parallel GPT&#8209;3-like models on distributed GPUs, based upon DeepSpeed and Megatron-LM.
    - in progress

## {class="content-block"}
- #### [The Pile](https://pile.eleuther.ai/)
    - [![alt](../../images/art43.png)](https://pile.eleuther.ai/)
    - The Pile is an **825 GiB** diverse, open source language modelling dataset consisting of data from 22 high quality sources. It is useful for both training and benchmarking large language models.
    - completed
- #### [OpenWebText2](projects/open-web-text2/)
    - [![alt](../../images/art4.png) ](projects/open-web-text2/)
    - OpenWebText2 is a dataset inspired by WebText, created by scraping URLs extracted from Reddit submissions up until April 2020 with a minimum score of 3 as a proxy for quality. It features content from multiple languages, document metadata, multiple dataset versions, and open source replication code.
    - completed
